# Reccomendation-Generator

This C software is a suggestion generator that interacts with the user by suggesting anime, movies, and books based on their preferences. This is how it works.

Input Validation Function:

The validateInput function determines whether the user's input is 'y' (yes) or 'n' (no). It returns true if the input meets the conditions, and false otherwise.

Main Function:

*The program begins by welcoming the user and outlining its purpose. 

*It asks the user to affirm whether they are prepared to answer questions with a 'yes' or 'no' response.

*If the user's response is invalid (not 'y' or 'n'), the application shows an error message and exits with an error code.

*If the user is ready to answer questions ('y'), it will ask them a series of questions about their anime, movie, and book tastes.

*For each category (anime, movies, and literature), the computer asks particular questions and makes recommendations depending on the answers.

*Recommendations are made for several genres within each area, such as action, comedy, mecha, horror, mystery, thriller, and fantasy.

*If the user's preference cannot be identified for a certain category, the computer makes generic recommendations.

*After making recommendations for each category, the computer thanks the user and invites them to return whenever they're ready.

Handling invalid inputs:

*If the user enters an invalid input (other than 'y' or 'n'), the application will display an error message and exit with an error code.

*Overall, this program is an interactive tool that recommends entertainment possibilities based on the user's preferences in anime, movies, and literature.
